<ul>
  <li>Limit Superior and Limit Inferior for a sequence ${x_n ~:~ n=1,2,â€¦}$ are defined as</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} x_n \triangleq \inf_n \sup_{k \ge n} x_k</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\underline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} x_n \triangleq \sup_n \inf_{k \ge n} x_k</script>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>topology</strong> on a set $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li>$\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\tau$.</li>
      <li>The union of elements of any subcollection of $\tau$ is in $X$.</li>
      <li>The intersection of the elements of any <em>finite</em> subcollection of $\tau$ is in $X$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A set $X$ for which topology $\tau$ has been identified is called a <strong> topological space. </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A subset $U \subseteq X$ is an <strong> open set </strong> of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection $\tau$. If $U$ is an open set containing $x$, then $U$ is called to be a <strong>neighborhood</strong> of $x$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are two topologies on a given set $X$, and $\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2$, then $\tau_2$ is a <strong> finer </strong> topology than $\tau_1$ and $\tau_1$ is <strong> coarser </strong> than $\tau_2$.</li>
</ul>
