<ul>
  <li>A <strong> group </strong> is a set $G$ along with a rule <script type="math/tex">\odot</script> for combining elements $a, b$ of $G$ such that
    <ul>
      <li><em>Closure</em>: For all $a, b$ in $G$ we have $a \odot b \in G$.</li>
      <li><em>Associativity</em>: For all $a, b, c$ in $G$ we have $(a \odot b) \odot c = a \odot (b \odot c)$.</li>
      <li><em>Identity element</em>: There exists a unique element $e$ in $G$ such that, for every element $a$ in $G$, the equation $e \odot a = a \odot e = a$ holds.</li>
      <li><em>Inverse</em>: For each $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$, commonly denoted $a^{-1}$ such that $a \odot b = b \odot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong> field </strong> is a set $F$ together with two binary operations on $F$ called <em>addition (+)</em> and <em>multiplication (.)</em>. A binary operation on $F$ is a mapping $F \times F \to F$, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of $F$ a uniquely determined element of $F$. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as <strong>field axioms</strong>. In these axioms, $a, b$, and $c$ are arbitrary elements of the field $F$.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Associativity of addition and multiplication:</em> $a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$, and $a Â· (b Â· c) = (a Â· b) Â· c$.</li>
      <li><em>Commutativity of addition and multiplication:</em> $a + b = b + a$, and $a Â· b = b Â· a$.</li>
      <li><em>Additive and multiplicative identity:</em> there exist two different elements 0 and 1 in $F$ such that $a + 0 = a$ and $a Â· 1 = a$.</li>
      <li><em>Additive inverses:</em> for every a in $F$, there exists an element in $F$, denoted $âˆ’a$, called the additive inverse of $a$, such that $a + (âˆ’a) = 0$.</li>
      <li><em>Multiplicative inverses:</em> for every $a \neq 0$ in $F$, there exists an element in $F$, denoted by $a^{âˆ’1}$, called the multiplicative inverse of $a$, such that $a Â· a^{-1} = 1$.</li>
      <li><em>Distributivity of multiplication over addition:</em> a Â· (b + c) = (a Â· b) + (a Â· c).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong> vector space</strong> $V$ over a field $F$ is a set together with two laws of composition.
    <ul>
      <li><em> addition:</em> $V \times V \to V$, written as $v, w \rightsquigarrow v+w$</li>
      <li><em> scalar multiplication:</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Limit Superior and Limit Inferior for a sequence $x_n$ are defined as</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\overline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} x_n \triangleq \inf_n \sup_{k \ge n} x_k</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\underline{\lim_{n \to \infty}} x_n \triangleq \sup_n \inf_{k \ge n} x_k</script>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A function $f: A \to B$ is <strong> surjective (onto) </strong> if every element of $B$ is the image of some element $A$ under the function $f$. It is <strong> injective (one-to-one)</strong> if for each pair of distinct points of $A$, their images under $f$ are different. And it is <strong> bijective </strong> if it is both injective and surjective.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>topology</strong> on a set $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ having the following properties:
    <ul>
      <li>$\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\tau$.</li>
      <li>The union of elements of any subcollection of $\tau$ is in $X$.</li>
      <li>The intersection of the elements of any <em>finite</em> subcollection of $\tau$ is in $X$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A set $X$ for which topology $\tau$ has been identified is called a <strong> topological space. </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A subset $U \subseteq X$ is an <strong> open set </strong> of $X$ if $U$ belongs to the collection $\tau$. If $U$ is an open set containing $x$, then $U$ is called to be a <strong>neighborhood</strong> of $x$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are two topologies on a given set $X$, and $\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2$, then $\tau_2$ is a <strong> finer </strong> topology than $\tau_1$ and $\tau_1$ is <strong> coarser </strong> than $\tau_2$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A topological space $X$ is called a <strong> Hausdorff space</strong> if for every pair $x_1, x_2$ of distinct points of $X$, there exist neighborhoods $U_1$ and $U_2$ of $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively, that are disjoint. This condition is a relatively strong condition and a looser condition which is called the <strong> $T_1$ axiom </strong> requires that finite point sets be closed. Every finite point set in a Hausdorff space is closed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces, a function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be <strong>continuous</strong> if for each open subset $V$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open set of $X$. If $f$ is bijective and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous, then $f$ is called a <strong>homeomorphism</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $X$ is a topological space, it is said to be <strong> metrizable </strong> if there exists a metric $d$ on the set $X$ that induces the topology of $X$. A <strong> metric space</strong> is a metrizable space, together with a specific metric $d$ that gives the topology of $X$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of a space $X$ is said to <strong> cover </strong> $X$ or to be a <strong> covering </strong> of $X$, if the union of the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ is equal to $X$. It is called an <strong> open covering </strong> of $X$ if its elemets are open subsets of $X$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A space $X$ is said to be <strong> compact </strong> if every open covering of $X$ contains a finite subcollection that covers $X$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A function $f$ from the metric space $(X, d_x)$ to the metric space $(Y, d_y)$ is said to be <strong> uniformly continuous </strong> if given $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists $\delta &gt; 0$ such that for every pair of points $x_0, x_1$ of $X$ such that $d_x(x_0, x_1) &lt; \delta$ we have $d_y(f(x_0), f(x_1)) &lt; \epsilon$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $X$ is a space, a point $x \in X$ is said to be an <strong> isolated point </strong> of $X$ if the one-point set $\{x\}$ is open in $X$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Given a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, the <strong> interior </strong> of $A$ denoted by <strong>Int $A$</strong> is defined as the union of all open sets contained in $A$. The <strong>closure</strong> of $A$ denoted by <strong> CI $A$ </strong> or $\bar{A}$ is defined as the intersection of all closed sets containing A. We have</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathrm{Int} A \subseteq A \subseteq \bar{A}</script>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A space $X$ is said to be <strong> limit point compact </strong> if every infinite subset of $X$ has a limit point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A space $X$ is said to be <strong> sequentially compact </strong> if every sequence of points of $X$ has a convergent subsequence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A space $X$ is said to be <strong> locally compact at point $x$ </strong> if there is some compact subspace $C$ of $X$ that contains a neighborhood of $x$. If space $X$ is locally compact at each of its points, $X$ is said to be <strong> locally compact.</strong> The real line $\mathbb{R}$ is locally compact while the subspace $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is not locally compact. Also $\mathbb{R}^n$ is locally compact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A sequence $\{x_n : n = 1, \dots \} \subseteq X$ where $X$ is a metric space with metric $\rho$ is called <strong>Cauchy</strong> if $\forall \epsilon &gt; 0, \exists N$ such that $\forall m,n &gt; N$, we have $\rho(x_m, x_n) &lt; \epsilon$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If $X$ is a metric space in which every Cauchy sequence $\{x_n: n=1,\dots\}$ converges to some element $x \in X$, i.e. $\rho(x_n,x) \to 0$, then $X$ is called <strong>complete</strong>.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $X$ be a simply ordered set having the least upper bound property. In the order topology, each closed interval in $X$ is compact. This proves that every closed interval in $\mathbb{R}$ is compact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extreme Value Theorem:</strong> Let $f :X \to Y$ be continuous, where $Y$ is an ordered set in the order topology. If $X$ is compact, then there exist points $c$ and $d$ in $X$ such that $f(c) \le f(x) \le f(d)$ for every $x \in X$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $f:X \to Y$ be a continuous map of the compact metric space $(X, d_x)$ to the metric space $(Y,d_y)$. Then $f$ is uniformly continuous.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $X$ be a nonempty compact Hausdorff space. If $X$ has no isolated points, then $X$ is uncountable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compactness implied limit point compactness but not conversely.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space. Then $X$ is locall compact if and only if given $x \in X$ and given a neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $\bar{V}$ is compact and $\bar{V} \subseteq U$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space and let $A$ be a subspace of $X$. If $A$ is closed in $X$ or open in $X$, then $A$ is locally compact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metric spaces are Hausdorff.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong> Urysohn Lemma: </strong> Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. If $K \subseteq X$ is compact and $U \subseteq X$ is an open set containing $K$, then there is a continuous function $f: X \to [0,1]$ such that $f=1$ on $K$ and $f=0$ on $U^c$.</li>
