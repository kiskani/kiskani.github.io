In this page, I will summarize a few tips related to training and use of machine learning models and techniques. 

# Dropout 

* Applying dropout to a neural network amounts to sampling a ``thinned'' network from
it. The thinned network consists of all the units that survived dropout. A
neural net with $n$ units, can be seen as a collection of $2^{n}$ possible thinned neural networks.
These networks all share weights so that the total number of parameters is still $O(n^2)$, or less. For each presentation of each training case, a new thinned network is sampled and
trained. So training a neural network with dropout can be seen as training a collection of $2^n$
thinned networks with extensive weight sharing, where each thinned network gets trained
very rarely, if at all.
