A few days ago a big tragedy happened. Today also marks the 2nd anniversary of one of the most tragedic events of my life. I am dedicating this page to the memories of the great people I have lost. This world is definitely a hesitation of pain and suffering.

I would also like to pay tribute to a great man who left us on May 23rd 2010.
