This is the personal github page for Mohsen Kiskani. I am currently an applied researcher at Expedia Group working on auction bidding algorithms. I have a PhD in
Electrical Engineering from University of California Santa Cruz. I have also been a postdoctoral researcher in the same institute. Currently, I am interested in
machine learning and statistics.
